# AdventOfCode2023 "Lovelace Challenge"

Advent of Code 2023 https://adventofcode.com/2023/

My name is Dylan and I am doing Advent Of Code 2023 while
attempting to use a different language for each day! This is
my first time participating in Advent of Code, so I'll be
documenting the process as I go!

I decided to do it this way after reading through the journey
[Posted Here!](https://github.com/bereal/AdventOfCode2020). So go check that out!

## Day 1: Typescript

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Not knowing what to expect, I decided to start the first day using
the language I know the best. Only later did I realize that the
puzzles get more difficult as you get deeper into the challenge. So after
Day 1, I will start switching to lesser known languages and save my
better languages for the final days!

Typescript is my favorite language! I did struggle with this first puzzle though,
particularly on the second part. But I was able to get it figured out--though probably
not the most efficient way.

## Day 2: Clojure

[Clojure](https://clojure.org/)

I used this to learn more about Clojure.

- [Brave Clojure](https://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/)

I kind of randomly picked this language as the one to work with next. I know
absolutely nothing about it and have never used it before. I don't even know
what the syntax looks like. (Realized after I went to the website that Clojure
is a JVM language!)
